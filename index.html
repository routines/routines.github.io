title: Routines & Channels - coordinating asynchronous code

<div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Coordinating Asynchronous Code</h2>
  <div class="well well-lg">
    <p class="lead">
      <span class="label label-success">RCH</span> provides JavaScript primitives that make it possible to <b>coordinate asynchronous code</b> without callbacks or chained functions.
    <p>
      As a result, stack traces are crystal clear so debugging is easy.
    </p>
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="small">
    Although other solutions also try to make it easier to deal with callback hell,
    race conditions, and code coordination, they suffer from the same problem as callbacks/events
    in that they intertwine control flow and communication. This results in esoteric
    code that is harder to grok.
  </p>

  <p class="small">
    RCH is inspired by Goroutines and Channels, found in the Go language.

    <h4>Coordinating concurrent activities using Routines and Channels</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      <b>Routines</b> and <b>Channels</b> make programs with concurrent behavior (e.g. user can navigate through a list while
      data gets downloaded) much easier to write and understand because you can use standard control
      flow mechanisms like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, conditionals like <code>if/then/else</code>
      and <code>case</code>, higher order functions like <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> and
      error handling using <code>try/catch</code>.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h4>go</h4>
    <p>
      go is a function that starts executing a routine concurrently with other routines.
      Start a concurrent routine by calling it with the <code>go</code> function:
      <pre>
        go(someFunction);
      </pre>

      You can also pass a function literal, e.g.
      <pre>
        go(function* (x, y) {
            var answer = x + y;
            console.log('answer=' + answer);
        });
      </pre>
      Notice that the function is declared with an asterisk <code>function*</code>. This makes it a Generator function, which
      is new in the upcoming version of JavaScript, but that can be used today by transpiling your code to ES5 using Google Traceur.
      (you can declare Generators in NodeJS 0.11 when running with the -harmony flag).
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h4>Chan</h4>
    <p>
      A channel is created with <code>new Chan()</code> and it provides an API for sending/receiving data between two routines. Channels are
      unbuffered/synchronous which has the nice effect that they combine communication (data exchange) with synchronization,
      guaranteeing that two routines are in a known state at any given time.
    </p>

    <p>
      A routine can put data into a Channel by calling <code>yield chan.put('someData')</code>, and another routine can get data by calling
      <code>yield chan.get()</code>. The <code>yield</code> keyword causes the routine to suspend executation until another routine issues
      an opposite request on the same Channel. When this happens, the routines are said to rendezvous; they are now synchronized, and will
      each continue code execution until they reach another <code>yield</code> statement.
    </p>

    <h4>simple example</h4>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      This example was inpired by David Nolen's <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes/">example</a> for Clojure(Script)'s core.async.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <pre>
          var chan = new Routines.Chan(),
              timeout = Routines.timeout,
              go = Routines.go;


          go(function* () {
              while (yield timeout(250).get()) {
                  chan.send(1);
              }
          });

          go(function* () {
              while (yield timeout(1000).get()) {
                  chan.send(2);
              }
          });

          go(function* () {
              while (yield timeout(1500).get()) {
                  chan.send(3);
              }
          });

          go(function* () {
              var data;
              while (data = yield chan.get()) {
                  console.log(data);
              }
          });
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>We create a new channel that the two routines will use to communicate & synchronize on.</p>
        <p><code>timeout</code>is a standard channel that waits for the specified amount of time
          before it puts data in the channel, signalling to a waiting routine that the time as expired.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p>Now we start our first routine. It runs every 250ms (<code>yield timeout(250).get()</code>),
          sending the value "1" to the channel.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <p>Similarly, we have a second and third routine, with 1000ms and 1500ms cadences respectively,
          each sending values to the channel.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <p>
          The fourth routine waits until it can get data from the channel and then simply displays it to the user.

      Building an autocomplete search input that is responsive, efficient, and correct can be tricky.
      For a good user experience, it requires careful coordination of user input events and API requests.
