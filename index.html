            <span class="label label-success">Async.es</span> is a minimal library that
            makes it easy to <b>coordinate complex concurrent</b> streams of events and other data
            using <b>plain</b> JavaScript. No callbacks or chained functions in sight.

          <p>As a result, stack traces are crystal clear so debugging is easy.
            You also get to keep try/catch!

        <p class="small">
          Although Promises and RxJS also try to make it easier to deal with callback hell,
          race conditions, and code coordination, they suffer from the same problem as callbacks/events
          in that they intertwine control flow and communication. This results in esoteric
          code that is harder to grok.

          <h4>Coordinating concurrent activities using Jobs and Pipes</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            <b>Jobs</b> and <b>Pipes</b> make programs with concurrent behavior (e.g. user can navigate through a list while
            data gets downloaded) much easier to write and understand because you can use standard control
            flow mechanisms like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, conditionals like <code>if/then/else</code>
            and <code>case</code>, higher order functions like <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> and
            error handling using <code>try/catch</code>.
          </p>

          <hr/>

          <h4>Job</h4>
          <p>
            A Job is a function executing concurrently with other Jobs.
            Start a Job by calling it with the <code>job</code> function:
            <pre>
              job(someFunction);
            </pre>
            
            You can also pass a function literal, e.g.
            <pre>
              job(function* (x, y) {
                  var answer = x + y;
                  console.log('answer=' + answer);
              });
            </pre>
            Notice that the function is declared with an asterisk <code>function*</code>. This makes it a Generator function, which
            is new in the upcoming version of JavaScript, but that can be used today by transpiling your code to ES5 using Google Traceur.
            (you can declare Generators in NodeJS 0.11 when running with the -harmony flag).
          </p>

          <hr/>

          <h4>Pipe</h4>
          <p>
            A Pipe is created with <code>new Pipe()</code> and it provides an API for sending/receiving data between two Jobs. Pipes are
            unbuffered/synchronous which has the nice effect that they combine communication (data exchange) with synchronization,
            guaranteeing that two Jobs are in a known state at any given time.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Job can put data into a Pipe by calling <code>yield pipe.put('someData')</code>, and another Job can get data by calling
            <code>yield pipe.get()</code>. The <code>yield</code> keyword causes the Job to suspend executation until another Job issues
            an opposite request on the same Pipe. When this happens, the Jobs are said to rendezvous; they are now synchronized, and will
            each continue code execution until they reach another <code>yield</code> statement.
          </p>

            This example was inpired by David Nolen's <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes/">example</a> for Clojure(Script)'s core.async.

              <pre>
        var pipe = new $async.Pipe(),
            timeout = $async.timeout,
            job = $async.job;

            
        job(function* () {
            while (true) {
                yield timeout(250).get();
                yield pipe.put(1);

        job(function* () {
            while (true) {

        job(function* () {
            while (true) {
                yield timeout(1500).get();
                yield pipe.put(3);
            }
        });

        job(function* () {
            var data;
            while (true) {
                data = yield pipe.get();
                console.log(data);            
            }
        });

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>We create a new pipe that the two jobs will use to communicate & synchronize on.</p>
              <p><code>timeout</code>is a standard pipe that waits for the specified amount of time
                before it puts data on the pipe, signalling to a waiting job that the time as expired.
              </p>
              <hr/>

              <p>Now we start our first job. It runs indefinitely (<code>while (true)</code>) and is pretty
                simple: every 250ms it puts the value "1" in the pipe.
              </p>

              <hr/>

              <p>Similarly, a second and third job, with 1000ms and 1500ms cadences respectively  at
                which it puts values into the pipe.
              </p>

              <hr/>

              <p>
                The fourth job also runs indefinitely, but it waits until it can get data from the pipe and
                then simply displays it to the user.

          <p>
            Building an autocomplete search input that is responsive, efficient, and correct can be tricky.
            This <a href="autocomplete.html">example</a> shows how trivially you can do it with async.es.
